# Goals

Develop a Touch-Typing application specifically for programmers. Touch-Typing is a special way to type, involving all 10 fingers, speeding up ones typing. To practice this technique one needs to do a lot of typing. This requires applications which generate text and provide guidance. However, coding syntax is different from normal text and current market solutions are limited. One of the main issues is the limited text that can be used to generate practice text.

To solve this problem, I employed neural nets. Specifically, I trained LSTMs and RNNs on source code from github repositories to generate next character given a piece of text. Currently, I am working on the 4th iteration of these models. The end goal is to have models that generate code like text and are able to differentiate between various programming languages.

Being new to web development and deep learning the main point of this project is to explore these areas and learn more.
